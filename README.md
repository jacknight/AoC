# Advent of Code

[View solutions](https://jacknight.github.io/AoC)

## Why?
I decided to do [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) 2020 in JavaScript for practice since I don't know JS, and it occurred to me that means I could pretty easily publish [the solutions](https://jacknight.github.io/AoC) using GitHub Pages. So that's what I am doing.

## Where's the Code?
Just view the source! It'll be at the bottom of the page within the `<script>` tag. Some of the code towards the end is just to display the answer and give myself a little button to copy the answer to the clipboard (why not). Probably just need to search for `answer = ` in most cases, and then work backwards from there.
